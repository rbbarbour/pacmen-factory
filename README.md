# PacMen Factory Exercise

## About
This program generates a PacMan with random velocities in the X- and Y-directions each time the button is pushed. The PacMen will continue moving in this randomly generated direction until they hit a boundary at which point they "bounce" and move in the opposite direction. As the PacMen move, their mouths open and close by cycling through images based on their X-direction and status.

## How to run
Clone the files to a local folder and open index.html in a web browser.
Click the "Add PacMan" button to generate a PacMan with random attributes including position and velocity.
Click the "Start Game" button to make the PacMen move around the screen.  After "Start Game" has been pressed, you may continue to "Add PacMan" as many times as you wish without interrupting their movement

## Roadmap
<ul>
<li>Start game automatically after one PacMan has been added to the DOM</li>
<li>Add trails to the PacMen to show their path.</li>
</ul>
